This game is very much in an alpha state. You start on a grass field near a sword and shield, both of which can be picked up and dropped. The sword emits light to test the multiple light source system. There is a test dummy to the south that doesn't do anything, but can be attacked and killed. There is a pink building to the north west, again testing the lighting/field of view system and collision detection. If you travel off the map to the north, you will find a new area with a large blue building. You can't move outside these two areas. This game is very much in an alpha state.
