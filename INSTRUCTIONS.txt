This game is very much in an alpha state. You start on a grass field near a sword and shield, both of which can be picked up([g]rabbed) and [d]ropped. Both can be equipped by selecting them from the [i]nventory menu. The sword emits light to test the multiple light source system. There is a test dummy to the south that attacks if the player gets too close. There is a pink building to the north west, again testing the lighting/field of view system and collision detection. You can find Pinkie Pie to the north, and [t]alk to her, although she doesn't say much yet. If you travel off the map to the north, you will find a new area with a large blue building, with a sky blue window and a brown door. Inside there are stairs down to a basement/dungeon. You can't move outside these two areas.

To play the game, run main.py through a Python 2.7.3 interpreter.
