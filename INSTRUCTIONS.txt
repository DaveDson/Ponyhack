This game is very much in an alpha state. You start on a grass
field near a sword and shield, both of which can be picked up
and dropped. The sword emitts light to test the multiple light
source system. There is a pink building to the north west, again
testing the lighting/field of view system and collision
detection. If you travel off the map to the north, you will find
a new area with a large blue building. You can't move outside
these two areas.
